### Air Quality Analysis: Delhi, January 2023

This project analyzes air quality data for Delhi, India in January 2023. Key findings include:

Predominantly Poor Air Quality:

1. Over 97% of the time, Delhi's air quality fell into the "Very Poor" or "Severe" categories.
2. This highlights concerning pollution levels with potential health risks.
3. Nighttime AQI Slightly Higher: On average, nighttime AQI was marginally higher than daytime AQI.
